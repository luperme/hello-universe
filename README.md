10 'Hello World' programs in 10 different languages that I haven't tried before...

In order to write in languages I haven't attempted yet, I had to venture out into the realm of obscurity and find programming languages that had more questions associated with them than projects! However, I started with a few mainstream ones that I hadn't had the time to try to get myself going.

# C#
This one was reminiscient of my first experiences with coding ever, using Java - the structure is similar and comfortable. The only hitch was setting up the compiler via command line; I don't have much with the CLI in general so this was good practice.
